# Postal Delivery System: Enterprise Data Architecture

A comprehensive data architecture solution for large-scale postal and delivery services, inspired by industry leaders like USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DTDC. This project implements a complete data pipeline from operational database design to analytical dashboards.

## System Architecture

The system follows a traditional on-premises architecture with three main components:
1. Operational Database (OLTP)
2. Data Warehouse (OLAP)
3. Business Intelligence Layer

### Technology Stack

- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL
- **Database Client**: DBeaver
- **ETL Tool**: Talend Open Studio
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Design Tools**: Draw.io
- **Version Control**: Git

## Project Components

### 1. Operational Database Design
- Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) model for the operational database
- UML diagrams capturing system behavior and relationships
- Complete database schema implementation in PostgreSQL
- Test data generation and loading scripts

### 2. Data Warehouse Architecture
- Snowflake schema implementation for optimal analytical querying
- Dimension modeling for:
  - Customer dimensions
  - Location dimensions
  - Time dimensions
  - Service dimensions
- Fact tables for:
  - Delivery transactions
  - Customer interactions
  - Service performance metrics

### 3. ETL Pipeline
- Data extraction from operational database
- Complex transformations including:
  - Data cleaning and standardization
  - Dimension hierarchy creation
  - Fact table aggregations
  - Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) handling
- Automated loading procedures into the data warehouse

### 4. Analytics and Visualization
- Interactive dashboards for:
  - Delivery performance metrics
  - Customer satisfaction analysis
  - Revenue and cost analytics
  - Operational efficiency indicators
- Custom reports for stakeholder analysis
